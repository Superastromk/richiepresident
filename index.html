<h3> Richy Zheng is a ninth grader, a responsible, and also fun one. You can also see how smart he is; his overall average was a 98!! He also has a brother in 7th grade named Charlie. </h3>
<h2> So why do we vote for this guy again? </h2>
<h3> Richy Zheng for school president. But why? Because he isnt gonna be like others and say "Alright im president now and ima do my homework goodbye.". He is going to take the responsibility of being president, and he actually will care about what the studets like and/or want. </h3>
<hr></hr>
<h2> What exactly is he going to do as president? </h2>
<h3> Alright. So we have established who Richy Zheng is, and why we should vote him. But what will he DO as president? I asked him this, and this was his response. "School will become more fun, with community service with the impact/key clubs, there will be more events, and as I am a student myself, I will work to make school as fun as possible.". I dont think the other candidates are going to do that! </h3>
<h2> Why does he want to be President? </h2>
<h3> Richy Zheng wants to be President of the Student Council for a multitude of reasons. First, he wants to make school more fun. He also would like to have more events to fun places like arcades and all that! </h3>
